# inclusion-analytics-assignment

Thank you for stopping by and checking out this data visualization project. 

- To run this project in your system, make sure you're using a live server as there are data files (csv) included with javascript fetch call. And a server is required for this.
-  Easiest way to run this is in your Visual Studio Code editor by opening the "home.html" and right clicking on the file selection "open with live server".
-  If you do not have VSCode, you can run it with any server.
